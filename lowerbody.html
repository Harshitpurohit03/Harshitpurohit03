               <p>The squat is a fundamental movement pattern that requires multiple joint and muscle integration. Babies squat perfectly. And then we unlearn this in favor of bending over.<p/>

               <p> As a dynamic strength training exercise, squats require several muscles in your upper and lower body to work together simultaneously/
                
                Many of these muscles help power you through daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, bending, or carrying heavy loads. They also help you perform athletic-related activities.
                
                Adding squats to your workouts can help boost your exercise performance, decrease your risk of injury, and keep you moving more easily throughout the day. But these are just a few of the benefits.
                
                Keep reading to learn more about the rewards you can reap from doing squats and variations you can try for added benefits. </p>

 To do a basic squat:

 Start with feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes turned slightly out.
 Keeping your chest up and out and the pressure even in your feet, engage your abdominals and shift your weight back into your heels as you push your hips back.
 Lower yourself into a squat until either your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Your depth should be determined by your form.
 Keep your chest out and core tight as you push through your heels to stand back up to your starting position. Squeeze your glutes at the top.
 Perform 10–15 reps. Work up to 3 sets

            Wall Sit

        <h1 class="text-small">
            Targets: Quadriceps, glutes, calves
        </h1>
        <p>The wall sit exercise is a real quad burner, working the muscles in the front of your thighs. This exercise is generally used for building isometric strength and endurance in the quadriceps muscle group, glutes, and calves.1

            The wall sit is not a complicated exercise, but many people get it wrong. You know that you are performing the wall sit properly if you form a right angle (90 degrees) at your hips and your knees, your back is flat against the wall, and your heels are on the ground. You should be able to feel a slight pulling of the quad area. You can do this exercise as part of any lower body routine.

            Adjust your feet so your knees are directly above your ankles (rather than over your toes).
            Keep your back flat against the wall.
            Hold the position for 20 to 60 seconds.
            Slide slowly back up the wall to a standing position.
            Rest for 30 seconds and repeat the exercise three times. Increase your hold time in five-second increments as you increase your strength.
