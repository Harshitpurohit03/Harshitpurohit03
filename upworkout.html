                The push-up builds both upper-body and core strength.1 It has many modifications; beginners can start with easier versions, while more advanced exercisers can use a challenging variation. You can do the push-up as part of a bodyweight exercise session, a circuit training workout, or a strength workout.

                How To Do PushUps?
            </h1>

<p> To do a push-up you are going to get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Once in this position, here is how you will do a push-up.</p>
<ul>

Contract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. 
Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.
Exhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position

            A pull-up is an upper-body exercise that involves hanging from a pull-up bar by your hands with your palms facing away from you, and lifting your entire body up with your arm and back muscles until your chest touches the bar. The pull-up movement uses multiple muscles at once, making it a compound exercise. 

            When performing the movement you should focus on using your arms and shoulder muscles, and avoid shrugging your shoulders up.
            
            Just like any bodyweight back exercise, this movement uses your body weight as resistance rather than external weights. While the exercise itself is relatively simple, mastering it can be tricky for those who are new to strength training.

                How To Do PullUps?
            </h1>

<p> </p>Here’s how to do a pull-up with the correct technique:

Start by standing directly below a pull-up bar. Place your hands in an overhand grip (palms facing away from your body) with your hands slightly further than shoulder-width apart. If you can’t reach the bar from standing on the floor, you can place a box beneath you and stand on that. Once your hands are holding onto the bar, you’re in your starting position.
Inhale, then exhale. Lift your feet up from the floor or box so that you’re hanging from the bar, and engage your core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Pull your shoulders back and down.
Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your elbows toward your hips if that makes the movement easier. As you move, avoid swinging your legs around or shrugging your shoulders up. You want to make sure your shoulder blades remain back and down throughout the exercise.
At the top of the movement, inhale. Then extend your elbows and lower your body back down to the starting position.

            Lie facedown (forehead to the mat) with arms extended forward above head, hands in fists, and thumbs pointing up to the ceiling, so arms form an “I” shape.

            Raise your arms as high as you can, hold for 1 count, and then lower them back to the floor. Next, make a “Y” with your arms and raise and lower them, and then do the same in a “T” position. Continue to repeat the letters.
